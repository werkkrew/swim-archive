# The Swim Meet Results Archive
This project started out as a means of me collecting and archiving swim meet results for my daughter. It has since evolved into me making a complete archive, for as far back in time as I can manage, of all of the results for the league(s) she swims in. I have some additional plans as well, but we'll see how that goes.

For now, I am archiving the data for the teams I am personally involved with and sharing them here for posterity.

## Initial Goals
 - [ ] Present a complete online archive of swim meet results for the [Perkiomen Valley Aquatic Club](https://pvaquatic.com), including USA meets.
 - [ ] Present a complete online archive of swim meet results for the [Suburban Aquatic League](https://suburbanaquatic.org).
   - [ ] Notate changes in division, teams, etc. year over year.
   - [ ] Provide interesting links to the team website as they were during the year of the season?
 - [ ] Present a complete online archive of swim meet results for the [Tri-County Swim League](https://tricountyswim.net).
 - [ ] Fully functional without any javascript
 - [ ] Additional JS based features
   - [ ] Scroll back to top button
   - [ ] Filter / Highlight Season by Team
   - [ ] Theme Switcher?
 - [ ] Contact form

## Future Plans
 - Parse the results files and maintain an actual database with the information contained within to provide a:
   - Fully searchable, sortable archive of meet results
   - Provide a way to view a swimmers progress over time, or view a particular swimmers history
   - Pave the way for a future app or platform to allow for analytics
 - Potentially expand upon the idea to create an app (web, mobile native, or both) where anyone can add meet results for anyone and track their or their kids progress throughout their swimming career.
   - This could be an almost "social network" for swimmers but is also probably far beyond my skillset and motivation
