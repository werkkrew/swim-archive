# The Swim Meet Results Archive
This project started out as a means of me collecting and archiving swim meet results for my daughter. It has since evolved into me making a complete archive, for as far back in time as I can manage, of all of the results for the league(s) she swims in. I have some additional plans as well, but we'll see how that goes.

For now, I am archiving the data for the teams I am personally involved with and sharing them here for posterity.

## Initial Goals
 - Present a complete online archive of swim meet results for the [Perkiomen Valley Aquatic Club](https://pvaquatic.com), including USA meets
 - Present a complete online archive of swim meet results for the [Suburban Aquatic League](https://suburbanaquatic.org)
   - Notate changes in division, teams, etc. year over year
   - Provide interesting links to the team website as they were during the year of the season
 - Present a complete online archive of swim meet results for the [Tri-County Swim League](https://tricountyswim.net)

## Future Plans
 - Parse the results files and maintain an actual database with the information contained within to provide a:
   - Fully searchable, sortable archive of meet results
   - Provide a way to view a swimmers progress over time, or view a particular swimmers history
   - Pave the way for a future app or platform to allow for analytics
 - Potentially expand upon the idea to create an app (web, mobile native, or both) where anyone can add meet results for anyone and track their or their kids progress throughout their swimming career.
   - This could be an almost "social network" for swimmers but is also probably far beyond my skillset and motivation

## Frequently Asked Questions
 - Why are the results in a plain text/html format?
   - Because the de-facto software the leagues I am involved in uses ([Meet Manager](https://hytek.active.com/swim-meet-software.html)) exports files to this format and historically it has been the preferred ways teams share meet results online. As such, going back in the years, this is the format I have been able to retrieve.
 - Some results are missing, why?
   - Aside from the meets I run myself, I am at the behest of the other teams in the league, or the leagues themselves to provide access to the results. If they don't, I have no way to obtain them.
   - Additionally, many teams did not have an online presence before around 2003 or so, finding results from before that time period has proven quite difficult.
   - Results before 1999-2000 seem almost impossible to find. I am not sure when running meets became electronic but finding results from before the era where meets are managed via software will likely prove difficult if not impossible.
 - I have some results you are missing or know someone who does, how can I provide them to you?
   - Simply open a pull request or email me, I will be more than happy to fill in any gaps I have in my inforation.
 - Can you add my team or league to this archive?
   - Maybe, see the future plans up above. For now this is mostly just a static archive of some local teams I am involved in but it may grow beyond that.
 - Can I download a copy of this archive?
   - Sure, clone this repository or download it in it's entirity from github.
