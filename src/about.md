# Hi, I'm Bryan and I like data.

This project started out with me being a little bit obsessive about collecting and archiving the results from every swim meet my daughter swims in. I didn't start doing this until recently, so when I was trying to hunt down results from meets that happened a couple of years ago, I found that in many cases they were a lot more difficult to find than I felt they should have been.

Presently, I am the vice president and webmaster for the [Perkiomen Valley Aquatic Club](https://pvaquatic.com) or PVAC for short. This is the team my daughter swims with in the winter. I am also the webmaster for my daugters summer swim team, the [Skippack Dolphins](https://www.gomotionapp.com/team/rectcslsst/page/home). The reason this site exists is because on team sites themselves I am highly limited as to what I can do. These sites run on a proprietary platform for team management and what I am able to do with the web frontend is not as robust as I wanted. I used this as an excuse to dust off the old webdev skills and make a dedicated site for meet results. I have decided to take it upon myself as the webmaster of these clubs to start maintaining an archive of meet results going as far back as I can find for posterity.

## Ok cool. So what is the point of this site?

Right now, this site is intended to simply be a mostly static online archive of all of the swim meet results I can dig up as they relate to the [Suburban Aquatic League](https://suburbanaquatic.org), the [Tri-County Swim League](https://tricountyswim.net/index.html), and PVAC's activities with [USA Swimming](https://www.usaswimming.org/). While these leagues do maintain their own [archives of meet results](https://suburbanaquatic.org/index.php/meet-results-archive/), they are often incomplete and do not go as far back as I wanted to dig.

Over time this site may evolve, who knows? Maybe it will become an online archive for more than just the clubs I am involved in, maybe it will become **THE** online archive for meet results on the web!
