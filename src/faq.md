# Frequently Asked Questions

Okay, not really. No one has asked me any questions yet, but these are some answers to the questions I *imagine* you might have...

## Why are the meet results in a plain text format?

Because these flat files are one of the formats the de-facto software used by pretty much every swim team in the world, [Hy-Tek Meet Manager](https://hytek.active.com/swim-meet-software.html), exports to. Most clubs, especially in the earlier days of the internet, used these files to post results online. As such, these are the predominant format of results I have been able to find. This software can export data in a variety of much more useful formats, but unfortunately finding old results in those formats is quite rare.

## Some results are missing or incorrect, why?

Short answer: because I was unable to find them. If I know a meet took place but I was unable to find the results, I left the artifact of the meet in place as a reminder that I need to find those results. Unless I ran the meet myself, I am at the behest of the leagues and teams to provide those results online somewhere, and that is not always the case.

Additionally, most teams did not have a web presence before around the year 2000. I am not sure when it became common to run swim meets using software but I suspect that beyond a certain point in time the results are on literal paper and have been lost to time.

As for incorrect results, if I have linked to something incorrectly or you feel a set of results is inaccurate, feel free to contact me and I will do my best to fix it.

## I have some results you are missing or know someone who does, how can I help?

Simply contact me or have that person contact me. I will be more than happy to fill in any gaps I have in my information.

## Can you add results from my team or league to this archive?

Maybe. In the future I might expand the scope of this site. For now this is mostly just a static archive of some local teams I am involved in but it may grow beyond that. I actually have some pretty grandiose plans but we'll see if any of that actually comes to fruition or not.

## Can I download a copy of this archive as a whole?

Sure, clone the [repository](https://github.com/werkkrew/swim-archive) or download a [release archive](#) it in it's entirity from github.
